You need to know exactly how your software performs so you can identify issues, resolve them quickly, and track improvements. And you want to learn from each iteration so your software, customer experience, and business outcomes become even better.

Our guides provide a foundation you can build on and customize based on your goals. During each step of your journey, we can help you with recommended key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboards, how-to docs, and more. If you're not yet a New Relic customer and you have questions, [contact New Relic sales](https://newrelic.com/contact-sales).
