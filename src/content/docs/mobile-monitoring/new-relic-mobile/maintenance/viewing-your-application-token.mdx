One of our [data ingest keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys) is our mobile monitoring application token. For each mobile app you monitor, we automatically assign a unique, 40-character hexadecimal string to that app, for both the US and EU datacenter. This token is required to authenticate your app's data.

To view your application token:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click **Mobile**, and select a monitored app.
2. Select **Application** or **Installation**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Data reported from your mobile app is tied to a named app based on the application token. All apps with a single application token will report to the same place in our mobile monitoring UI, regardless of the app's name when installed on a mobile device. We recommend using a different application token for each platform to separate iOS and Android versions.
