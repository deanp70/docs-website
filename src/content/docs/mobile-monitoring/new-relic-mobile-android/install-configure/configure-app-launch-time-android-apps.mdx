With the Android agent, you can report app launch time, also known as "cold time" and "hot time." 

## Configure app launch time [#app-launch-time]

<Callout variant="important">
This feature is available for agent versions 6.9.0 and higher.
</Callout>

To enable the Android agent to report app launch time: Add the following to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```
   <application>

    <!-- make sure to provide unique authorities if apply to multiple apps on the same device -->
     <provider
        android:name="com.newrelic.agent.android.rum.contentprovider.NewRelicAppContentProvider"
        android:authorities="com.newrelic.android.agent.nrprovider.${applicationId}"
        android:initOrder="200"
        android:exported="false"/>
        
  </application>
   ```
   
Your app launch time is reported with the `AppLaunch/Cold` and `AppLaunch/Hot` [metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics). Here's an example query of your app launch time:

If no data appears, review your `logcat` output for errors.
