  This feature is currently a public preview. [Activate your free trial](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management) through January 31.   
</Callout>

Overcome security blindspots with the New Relic vulnerability management capability. Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.

New Relic vulnerability management provides a birds eye view of all your software’s vulnerabilities so you can:
- Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities
- Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software 
- Triage and assign vulnerabilities to users with explicit remediation steps provided

[Activate your free trial](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management) to get started today.
