title: Send Snyk data to New Relic
---

You can import Snyk findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities. 

After completion of these steps, you will see new vulnerabilities detected by Snyk in your New Relic account in real time, and you'll be able to build out analytics dashboards newly detected issues.

## Enable the Snyk webhook

To enable our Snyk integration:

1. If you haven't already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.
