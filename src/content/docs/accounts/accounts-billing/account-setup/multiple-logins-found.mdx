If your email is associated with multiple user records, you'll see a `Multiple logins found` message at login, then you'll be asked to verify your email. This might happen if you have access to multiple New Relic organizations, or to multiple [authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) in an organization.

<figcaption>When you have two or more user records for the same email address, you'll receive a message about this during login.</figcaption>

When a user record is marked as `Original` on the login page, as shown above, that means that user record is on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models). 

Verifying your email address will allow you to choose which user record to access. If you don't verify your email address, New Relic will try to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address.

To avoid having to verify your email for each login, click the **Remember me** checkbox on the login screen.
