metaDescription: How to add accounts to your New Relic organization. 
---

Some New Relic organizations have the ability to add more accounts to their organization. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements for the ability to add an account to an organization: 

* Pro or Enterprise edition (Standard allows only one account per organization).
* User must be a core user or full platform user with [**Organization settings**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).
* Organizations with [partnership accounts](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions) must use the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api) to add accounts. 

## Why add an account? [#why-add-accounts]

You should try to minimize the number of accounts you have in your New Relic organization, and not create an account without a good reason. For reasons to add accounts, see [Organization and account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

## Add accounts [#add-accounts]

How you add an account depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) your users are on: 

* Our newer user model: 
  * To add an account from the UI: from the **Access management** UI page, click **Accounts**, and then click **Create account**. Learn more about [user management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where).
  * To add an account via API: see [Manage accounts with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph).
  * To learn about organization and account structure, see [Organization structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 
* Our original user model: see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/#creating). 
* To cancel an account, please file a ticket to our global technical support team. For how to file a support ticket, refer to this [link] https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal/#file-ticket
