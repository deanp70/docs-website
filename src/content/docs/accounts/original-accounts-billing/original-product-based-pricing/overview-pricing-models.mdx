New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models, and we have separate sets of docs for each pricing model:

* Our usage-based pricing ([see docs](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing)): this is our newer pricing model, which bills based on usage: data ingested and number of billable users. All New Relic organizations created on or after July 30, 2020 are on this model, as are some older organizations that have [switched to this model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models/). Eventually all New Relic customers will be on the usage-based model.
* Our original product-based pricing model ([see docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing)): our older model involves subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). For information about switching to this model, see [Transition to new pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models).

### Determine your pricing model [#determine-pricing]

To determine which pricing model your organization is on: go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **Manage your plan**. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you're on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing).

### Convert to new pricing [#switch-pricing]

Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. [Learn more about switching your pricing model.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models)
