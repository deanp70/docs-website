## Change user name [#user-name]

To change your user name:
1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User preferences**.
2. On the right side, click **Full name**.

Note that if a user is managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), they can't change their name from the UI.  

## Change account name [#account-name]

A Pro or Enterprise edition organization can have one or more accounts. How to change the name of an account differs depending on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models) you're on: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="new-user-model"
    title="Our newer user model"
  >
To add and rename accounts: 

* From the [Access management UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail), click **Accounts**. 
* For the account you want to rename, click `...` and then click **Edit account**.  

You can also use [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph). 

  </Collapser>


  <Collapser
    id="original-user-model"
    title="Our original user model"
  >
To change the name of an account:
1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**.
2. On the right side, edit the **Name** field.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

If you can't change an account name, it may be because: 
* You don't have required permissions
* You have a partnership account structure: in that case, use [the Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object)
