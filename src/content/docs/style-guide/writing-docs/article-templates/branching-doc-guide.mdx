title: How to create a branching doc from scratch
metaDescription: Our branching doc framework is a powerful tool that we can use to dynamically swap content in and out of, depending on a set of choices.
---

Branching docs are a powerful tool to offer different paths through our documentation, depending on what options users choose. In the past, we might have represented these choices as a table or a set of collapsers. This new doc format is a flexible and extensible tool that we can use to consolidate our installation docs and innovate on how we present information across our site.

These branching docs are controlled by a configuration YAML file that maps out the relationships between different options. The YAML outlines when and how small snippets of information (contained in individual .mdx files) populate the page. As users respond to prompts, the YAML swaps those snippets in and out.

## New components [#new-components]

The branching doc introduces some new components. Some of these components are available for use across the docs site, whether it's a branching doc or not.

The new universal components are:

* installation-specific feedback form
* tab switcher

The branching-specific components are:

* dropdown menus with image-based tile selection
* numbered steps with related titles
* embedded, customizable config text file that can be copied or downloaded

### Installation feedback form [#installation-feedback]

Stay tuned!

### Tab switcher [#tab]

The tab switcher, like collapsers, is a React component that presents an alternate set of content in a single location.

```
<Tabs>
	<TabsBar>
		<TabsBarItem id=""></TabsBarItem>
		<TabsBarItem id=""></TabsBarItem>
		<TabsBarItem id=""></TabsBarItem>
	</TabsBar>

	<TabsPages>
		<TabsPageItem id="">
		</TabsPageItem>
		<TabsPageItem id="">
		</TabsPageItem>
		<TabsPageItem id="">
		</TabsPageItem>
	</TabsPages>
</Tabs>
```


### Tile dropdown [#tile-dropdown] 

The tile dropdown is how a reader controls the branching content that's shown on a doc. The dropdown content and structure is controlled via the branching doc's YAML file.

### Numbered steps [#numbered-steps]

Nearly every MDX file in a branching doc is represented by a numbered step. The branching doc's numbered steps are automatically generated via the YAML file.

### Embedded config file [#config]

The APM agent config file is added to the `/install/config/agent-config` directory. Specific lines can be targeted in the config file for update by the reader.

## How it works [#how]

The install docs live in the `install` directory. There is a single `.yaml` file that defines how and when specific content is swapped in and out of the doc. The specific pieces of content are represented as `.mdx` files.

## Directory overview [#install-directory]

The install framework content lives in `src/install`. 

To create a new install doc, add a directory to `install`.

Your directory structure needs to look like this:

```
install
|--assets (used for install images)
|--config (used for the install yaml files)
   |--agent-config (used for the agent config yml files)
|--specific-install (used for a specific install doc)
   |--sub-directory1 (used for .mdx files that will be swapped in)
   |--sub-directory2 (used for .mdx files that will be swapped in)
   |--sub-directoryx (you can have as many sub-directories as you need)
```

When you start a new branching doc, create a parent directory under the `install` directory. This is where all of the files for your branching doc live.

## The branching YAML file [#yaml-overview]

The branching doc YAML file is a highly customizable way to generate a wide variety of custom, interactive content. Being a YAML file, it’s extremely important to pay attention to indents and to make sure that every piece of the YAML file is correct. 

<Callout variant="tip">
Your branching YAML file needs to end with the four-letter `.yaml` suffix.
</Callout>

When you swap in MDX content in your YAML file, the specific MDX file  needs to be local to your install doc directory (for example, Java). Although it might be tempting to link to content anywhere on the Docs site for the purposes of reuse, this will cause your doc to break.



### A sample YAML file [#sample-yaml]

This is a sample YAML file. You can find definitions of these fields in the next section.

```
agentName: pasta
 agentType: APM
 title: 'How to cook some great pasta'
 metaDescription: "All about making pasta."
 introFilePath: 'src/install/pasta/intro.mdx'
 agentConfigFilePath: 'src/install/config/agent-config/java-newrelic.yml'
 appInfo: 
   - optionType: diet
     label: 'What is your dietary preference?'
     placeholder: 'I eat...'
     options: 
       - value: 'omni'
         displayName: 'everything!'
         logo: 'docker'
       - value: 'vegan'
         displayName: 'everything but animal products'

               - value: 'vegan'
   - filePath: 'src/install/pasta/sauce.mdx'
 whatsNextFilePath: 'src/install/pasta/whatsNext.mdx'
```

## YAML field name details [#yaml-fields]

* agentName: the directory name where everything lives, also tied to the URL (/install/java)
* title: name of the doc, free text field
* introFilePath: the intro text for the page
* agentConfigFilePath: where the agent yml file lives
* appInfo: where you define the dropdowns
    * optionType: value used for overrides, used for query parameters, also used in places for component type appInfo.mdx, appInfoConfigOption, giving a name to the variable used elsewhere on the page 
    * label: name for the dropdown
    * placeholder: text that's there before you selected anything
* options
    * value: the variable for the name for the tile, hooks into the query param for the URL
    * displayName: the label of the tile
    * logo: this is an optional path to an image for the tile
    * icon: use this if you want to use an icon instead of an image (icon name="fe-server”)
    * recommendedGuided: Boolean, determines whether guided install content displays (optional)

* steps: steps section defines all the steps on the page, the order these are listed determines the order of the steps
    * filePath: this is the path to a .mdx file (default file content)
    * overrides: determines if an .mdx file is swapped in 
        * skip: Boolean, removes content
        * selectedOptions: this section hooks into the selected values in the app config to replace content
            * optionType: this connects to the appInfo variable name
            * options
                * value: connects to the specific item in a specific dropdown


## Branching MDX files [#mdx-overview]

When working with this install framework, there are specific MDX files to be aware of. The different MDX content types are specified via the `componentType` frontmatter field.

The different component types are:

* `intro`
    * Referenced in the YAML by `introFilePath`.
    * This is the content at the top of the page.
    * Used for intro content.
* `default` 
    * A freeform MDX file.
    * Use this for most of your content.
* `appInfo`
    * This is used to display the dropdown content, as well as content that's shown when the `recommendedGuided: true` flag is added to a step.
* `appInfoConfigOption` 
    * This is used to show dropdown content.
* `agentConfig` 
    * This is used to show the APM agent YML config file.

### A sample MDX file [#sample-mdx]

```
--- 
 headingText: Let's begin
 componentType: default
 ---

 Boil your water. 
```

### The appInfo MDX file [#sample-appinfo]

```
---
 componentType: appInfoConfig
 headingText: Tell us about your java app
 descriptionText: Select how your app is deployed and your framework. The page updates with the instructions you need for your exact Java setup, so you can start monitoring your app’s performance.
 ---

 ### We recommend the guided install for your app

 A single CLI-command you can run on your system to start monitoring your Java app.
 Java apps deployed via Tomcat, Wildfly/Jboss, and Jetty (standalone).

 <Button variant="primary">Guided Install</Button>

 If you would prefer to install manually you can follow the steps below.
```

### The agentConfig MDX file [#sample-agentconfig]

The `agentConfig` MDX file points to the appropriate config file in the install directory and controls which lines in the config file are editable.

```
 ---
 componentType: agentConfig
 headingText: Choose your download option
 descriptionText: Set your app name and license key. Then download your custom config file. You can also use more advanced config setting, see our docs.
 inputOptions: 
   - label: 'Name your app'
     name: "My app name"
     codeLine: 29
     defaultValue: 'My Application'
     toolTip: 'some random info text' 
   - label: 'Enter your '
     url: 
       href: 'http://one.newrelic.com/api-keys'
       title: 'New Relic license key'
     name: licenseKey
     codeLine: 15
     defaultValue: '12345'  
 configFilePath: 'assets/newrelic.yml'
 ---

 When using the config file, we recommend you: 
   * change the default `newrelic.yml` permissions to read/write only for the owner of the application server process.
   * make sure `newrelic.yml` is part of your backup routine.
   * use the [New Relic Diagnostics CLI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/run-diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/) to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy.
