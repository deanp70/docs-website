**This document is a template for a Prometheus integration document**: Please skim the entire template first to understand the expected structure for this type of doc. Delete all content up to **Introduction (this heading won't be visible)**.

**For the title** (the field at top of page): Give your doc a practical name that is focused on the specific integration.

## Introduction (this heading will not be visible) [#intro]

Provide a brief explanation about what this integration does and why you should use it. Mention the key use cases, the customer value, the reason for using this integration, and when to use it.

## Requirements

* Provide the versions we support.
* Additional requirements in bullets.

## Enable the integration

Write the steps to enable the integration beyond what is needed to install the Prometheus agent, if any. Use a 1, 2, 3 format like:

1. Do a thing
2. Do the next thing
3. Do the thing after that

## Configuration

List the optional configuration settings.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
       Name
      </th>

      <th>
       Data type 
      </th>
      
      <th>
       Options 
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      Name of the Prometheus integration  
      </td>

      <td>
      Type of data  
      </td>

      <td>
      Specify the options  
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Metrics

Don't list all metrics. We're only looking for the most important and valuable metrics (for example, golden signals) in this doc. Link to the provider's site for other metrics.

The [name_of_your_integration] integration collects the following data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
      Metric  
      </th>

      <th>
      Definition
      </th>

      <th>
      Full metrics list  
      </th>

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      Name of the metric  
      </td>

      <td>
      Definition of the metric
      </td>

      <td>
      Link to the full metric list and definitions on the provider's site
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
